# AI_Gen_Human
AI generated Human project 

Motivation to take this project started from the discussion video between Jack Ma and Elon Musk where Jack questions that "Humans built Computers but Computers never built humans!" This provoked me to investigate what can be done in making this project a reality. How far can we push a AI or a computer to understand what human is and what should be the best way human should exist. 

### My thougts
- Ultimately if we train a computer what all humans can do everyday from morning to evening and also at night we can ask it to guess how a human should look like to accomplish all these tasks.
- The horror story is that if we teach the computer that we built computers and we program them, and if it self aware... and if it is self aware then it might return the end of human race as the output :P HOPE THIS NEVER HAPPENS
- Additional thoughts: what happens if we havee AI planned city. where every recident is planned to be located based on his/her work, personal life preference. At the same time would the connections through roadways or railways be tangled and unconventional?
